# purescript-hyrule

A rock-hard fork of Phil Freeman's `purescript-event`.

While it remains true to the spirit of the original event, it adds lots of bells and whistles like memoization and event busses.

## Why Hyrule?

Hyrule is short for "Handles Your Reentrant Unimodal Lawvere Events." Or "Hermetic Yonedas over Reactive Universal Lazy Enclosures". It's probably short for some other stuff too.
